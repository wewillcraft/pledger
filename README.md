# Pledger

> "A name spoken is a vow begun."

**Pledger** is the keeper of names and oaths within the Guild. It is not merely a user service—it is a ledger of intent, a quiet scriptorium where those who would serve noble quests first speak their name and are remembered.

The name is forged from two truths:

- Pledge — The act of binding oneself to a cause, as a knight might kneel before their liege, or a crafter might take up tools in service of the greater good.
- Ledger — The record. Eternal, impartial, and sacred. It holds the names of those who have sworn themselves to the Order.

Together, they form _Pledger_: a place where purpose is written and identity is honored.

Behind every request lies a story; behind every name, a vow. These names are kept in a living record of all who have answered the call, whether active in the field or sleeping in silence, waiting to rise once more.

## Contributing

**Imposter syndrome disclaimer**: We want your help. No, really.

There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're not ready to be an open source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly good enough to contribute. What could you possibly offer a project like this one?

We assure you - the little voice in your head is wrong. If you can write code at all, you can contribute code to open source. Contributing to open source projects is a fantastic way to advance one's coding skills. Writing perfect code isn't the measure of a good developer (that would disqualify all of us!); it's trying to create something, making mistakes, and learning from those mistakes. That's how we all improve, and we are happy to help others learn.

Being an open source contributor doesn't just mean writing code, either. You can help out by writing documentation, tests, or even giving feedback about the project (and yes - that includes giving feedback about the contribution process). Some of these contributions may be the most valuable to the project as a whole, because you're coming to the project with fresh eyes, so you can see the errors and assumptions that seasoned contributors have glossed over.
